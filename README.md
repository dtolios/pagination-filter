# pagination-filter!
My twist on the pagination filter Treehouse project. Utilizes unobtrusive JavaScript techniques. 

Two custom modules built using jQuery:
- *Pagination*: Adds pagination buttons and limits student list to 10 items
- *Search*: Adds search functionality with both click and enter allowing user to search. Gracefully destroys and resets Pagination functionality
